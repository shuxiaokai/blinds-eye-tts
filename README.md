"# blinds-eye" 
### Idea behind the project is to give ability to understand surroundings and environment for blinds people who are unable to get insights around them. I have used yolov3, a object detection model to detect different objects in the frames through the camera and using Microsoft Azure Speech Services, user can interact through voice with the model to ask about what's happening around.

### The future plan for this project is to develop a spectacles like hardware which user can wear. The design somewhat would be similar to that of Google Glass.

### I'm still working on this project to improve and add more features, and in the future I plan to work on its hardware design.

### Also the future plan for this project is to develop as an assistant type, which can be used not only by blind person but every person.

## stay-tuned!!
